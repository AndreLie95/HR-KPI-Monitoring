# HR-KPI-Monitoring

This project was created to help HRD monitoring their KPI. The dataset was got from The Forage as Virtual Intership.
HR KPI I used in this project is:
1. Total of Male Employee
2. Total of Female Employee
3. Total of Employee
4. Total of Leaver Employee
5. % Turnover
6. % Employee Promotion
7. % Promotion by Gender
8. Hire Rate by Gender
9. Avg. Performance Rating Employee in FY 19 & FY 20

With this project I learn many skill such as Calculating Meansure using Power BI, Create KPI Dashboard, Make Dashboard Filter, and etc.
